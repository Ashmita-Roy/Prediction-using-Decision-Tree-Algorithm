# Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
Task-6 of GRIP {The Sparks Foundation}

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.

The workflow:
Step 1: Import dataset & libraries
Step 2: Visualize the dataset with Matplotlib & Seaborn
Step 3: Split dataset into train and test
Step 4: Build the decision tree model
Step 5: Visualize the model
